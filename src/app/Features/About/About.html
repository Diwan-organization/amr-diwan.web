			<h2>Amr Diwan</h2>
			<p>
				Egyptian Graffiti artist explored the different pillars of the hip-hop culture, increasing his knowledge every step of the way. In the early
				2000's he started to develop his artistic talents with each art piece.
			</p>
			<p>This led to the successful opening of Diwan Studios and the start of many imaginative and original graffiti pieces.</p>
			<p>
				Diwan has more than a passion for graffiti, he has a vision. With each stroke, he adds a customized sense of personality to the final outcome.
				Whether it is his own or the vision of the brand he is currently working with. But what makes Diwan's graffiti different? The flawless fusion of
				Arabic calligraphy with the unique techniques and style of graffiti.
